# 2048 Game

This is a simple web-based implementation of the popular 2048 game. The game is built using modern JavaScript (ES6 modules), HTML, and CSS. The goal is to combine tiles with the same numbers by sliding them using the arrow keys, trying to reach the 2048 tile.

## How to Use

To run this project, you can either use the Live Server extension in your code editor or run a local server using the command:

```
npx serve
```

Then open the provided local server URL in your browser.

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the tiles on the board.
When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one with their sum.
The game adds a new tile after every move.
The game ends when there are no valid moves left.
If you lose, an alert will notify you and the game will restart automatically.
